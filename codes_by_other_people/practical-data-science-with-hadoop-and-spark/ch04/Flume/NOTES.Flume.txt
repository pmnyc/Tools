Step 1: Simple Test
===================

# agent only needed on nodes that generate data 

flume-ng agent --conf conf --conf-file simple-example.conf --name simple_agent -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console

# in another window

telnet localhost 44444

  Trying ::1...
  telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  testing  1 2 3
  OK

# Flume agent shows

14/08/14 16:20:58 INFO sink.LoggerSink: Event: { headers:{} body: 74 65 73 74 69 6E 67 20 20 31 20 32 20 33 0D    testing  1 2 3. } 


Step 2: Web Log Example
=======================
# record the weblogs from the local machine (Ambari output)
# to HDFS using flume. Two file are needed:

  web-server-target-agent.conf - the target flume agent that writes the data to HDFS
  web-server-source-agent.conf - the source flume agent that captures the web log data

# First, as root make local log directory to echo the web log 

  mkdir /var/log/flume-hdfs
  chown hdfs:hadoop /var/log/flume-hdfs/

# Next, as user hdfs make a flume data directory in HDFS

  hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hdfs/flume-channel/

# Start flume target agent as user hdfs (writes data to HDFS)
# This agent should be started before the source agent.  
# Note: with HDP flume can be started as a service when the system boots
# e.g "service start flume" The /etc/flume/conf/{flume.conf,flume-env.sh.template}
# files need to be configured. For this example
# /etc/flume/conf/flume.conf would be the same as web-server-target.conf 

  flume-ng agent -c conf -f web-server-target-agent.conf -n collector

# as root, start the source agent to feed the target agent

  flume-ng agent -c conf -f web-server-source-agent.conf -n source_agent

# check to see if working (assuming no errors from flume-ng agents)
# inspect local log, as user hdfs (file name will vary)

  tail -f /var/log/flume-hdfs/1408126765449-1

# inspect data in HDFS (filename will vary)

  hdfs dfs -tail flume-channel/apache_access_combined/140815/FlumeData.1408126868576
