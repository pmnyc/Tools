Welcome to H2O 3
==================

New Users
---------

If you're just getting started with H2O, here are some links to help you
learn more:

-  `Recommended Systems <http://www.h2o.ai/product/recommended-systems-for-h2o/>`_: This one-page PDF provides a basic overview of
   the operating systems, languages and APIs, Hadoop resource manager
   versions, cloud computing environments, browsers, and other resources
   recommended to run H2O. At a minimum, we recommend the following for
   compatibility with H2O:

-  **Operating Systems**: Windows 7 or later; OS X 10.9 or later, Ubuntu
   12.04, or RHEL/CentOS 6 or later
-  **Languages**: Java 7 or later; Scala v 2.10 or later; R v.3 or
   later; Python 2.7.x or 3.5.x (Scala, R, and Python are not required
   to use H2O unless you want to use H2O in those environments, but Java
   is always required)
-  **Browsers**: Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet
   Explorer (An internet browser is required to use H2O's web UI, Flow)
-  **Hadoop**: Cloudera CDH 5.2 or later (5.3 is recommended); MapR
   v.3.1.1 or later; Hortonworks HDP 2.1 or later (Hadoop is not
   required to run H2O unless you want to deploy H2O on a Hadoop
   cluster)
-  **Spark**: v 1.4 or later (Spark is only required if you want to run
   `Sparkling Water <https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water>`__)

-  `Downloads page <http://www.h2o.ai/download/>`_: First things first - download a copy of H2O here by
   selecting a build under "Download H2O" (the "Bleeding Edge" build
   contains the latest changes, while the latest alpha release is a more
   stable build), then use the installation instruction tabs to install
   H2O on your `client of choice <http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/choose>`_
   (standalone, R, Python, Hadoop, or Maven).

   For first-time users, we recommend downloading the latest alpha
   release and the default standalone option (the first tab) as the
   installation method. Make sure to install Java if it is not already
   installed.

-  **Tutorials**: To see a step-by-step example of our algorithms in
   action, select a model type from the following list:

   -  `Deep Learning <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/tutorials/dl/dl.md>`_
   -  `Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/tutorials/gbm/gbm.md>`_
   -  `Generalized Linear Model (GLM) <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/tutorials/glm/glm.md>`_
   -  `Kmeans <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/tutorials/kmeans/kmeans.md>`_
   -  `Distributed Random Forest (DRF) <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/tutorials/rf/rf.md>`_

-  :ref:`using-flow`: This document describes our new intuitive
   web interface, Flow. This interface is similar to IPython notebooks,
   and allows you to create a visual workflow to share with others.

-  `Launch from the command line <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/howto/H2O-DevCmdLine.md>`_: This document describes some of the additional options that you can configure when launching H2O (for example, to specify a different directory for saved Flow data, to allocate more memory, or to use a flatfile for quick configuration of a cluster).

-  :ref:`Data_Science`: This document describes the science behind our algorithms and provides a detailed, per-algo view of each model type.

-  `GitHub Help <https://help.github.com/>`_: The GitHub Help system is a useful resource for becoming familiar with Git. 

New User Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New users can follow the steps below to quickly get up and running with H2O directly from the **h2o-3** repository. These steps guide you through cloning the repository, starting H2O, and importing a dataset. Once you're up and running, you'll be better able to follow examples included within this user guide.

1. In a terminal window, create a folder for the H2O repository. The example below creates a folder called "repos" on the desktop.

::

   user$ mkdir ~/Desktop/repos
   
2. Change directories to that new folder, and then clone the repository. Notice that the prompt changes when you change directories.

::

    user$ cd ~/Desktop/repos
    repos user$ git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git

3. After the repo is cloned, change directories to the **h2o** folder.

::

    repos user$ cd h2o-3
    h2o-3 user$

4. Run the following command to retrieve sample datasets. These datasets are used throughout this User Guide as well as within the `Booklets <http://www.h2o.ai/resources/>`_. 

::

   h2o-3 user$ ./gradlew syncSmalldata

At this point, determine whether you want to complete this quick start in either R or Python, and run the corresponding commands below from either the R or Python tab.

PySparkling
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: PySparkling requires Sparkling Water 1.5 or later.

H2O's PySparkling package is not available through ``pip``. (There is
`another <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysparkling/>`__ similarly-named
package.) H2O's PySparkling package requires
`EasyInstall <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`__.

To install H2O's PySparkling package, use the egg file included in the
distribution.

1. Download `Spark 1.5.1 <https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html>`__.
2. Set the ``SPARK_HOME`` and ``MASTER`` variables as described on the
   `Downloads
   page <http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/sparkling-water/rel-1.5/6/index.html>`__.
3. Download `Sparkling Water
   1.5 <http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/sparkling-water/rel-1.5/6/index.html>`__
4. In the unpacked Sparkling Water directory, run the following command:
   ``easy_install --upgrade sparkling-water-1.5.6/py/dist/pySparkling-1.5.6-py2.7.egg``



Python Users
--------------

Pythonistas will be glad to know that H2O now provides support for this
popular programming language. Python users can also use H2O with IPython
notebooks. For more information, refer to the following links.

R Users
-------

Currently, the only version of R that is known to be incompatible with
H2O is R version 3.1.0 (codename "Spring Dance"). If you are using that
version, we recommend upgrading the R version before using H2O.

To check which version of H2O is installed in R, use
``versions::installed.versions("h2o")``.

API Users
--------------

API users will be happy to know that the APIs have been more thoroughly
documented in the latest release of H2O and additional capabilities
(such as exporting weights and biases for Deep Learning models) have
been added.

REST APIs are generated immediately out of the code, allowing users to
implement machine learning in many ways. For example, REST APIs could be
used to call a model created by sensor data and to set up auto-alerts if
the sensor data falls below a specified threshold.

-  `H2O 3 REST API Overview <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/api/REST/h2o_3_rest_api_overview.md>`_: This document describes how the REST API
   commands are used in H2O, versioning, experimental APIs, verbs,
   status codes, formats, schemas, payloads, metadata, and examples.

Developers
--------------

If you're looking to use H2O to help you develop your own apps, the
following links will provide helpful references.

For the latest version of IDEA IntelliJ, run ``./gradlew idea``, then
click **File > Open** within IDEA. Select the ``.ipr`` file in the
repository and click the **Choose** button.

For older versions of IDEA IntelliJ, run ``./gradlew idea``, then
**Import Project** within IDEA and point it to the `h2o-3 directory <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3>`_.

**Note**: This process will take longer, so we recommend using the
first method if possible.

For JUnit tests to pass, you may need multiple H2O nodes. Create a
"Run/Debug" configuration with the following parameters:

::

    Type: Application
    Main class: H2OApp
    Use class path of module: h2o-app

After starting multiple "worker" node processes in addition to the JUnit
test process, they will cloud up and run the multi-node JUnit tests.
