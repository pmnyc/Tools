"""
Explicit @jit signatures can use a number of types. Here are some common ones:

void is the return type of functions returning nothing (which actually return 
    None when called from Python)
intp and uintp are pointer-sized integers (signed and unsigned, respectively)
intc and uintc are equivalent to C int and unsigned int integer types

int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64 are fixed-width integers 
    of the corresponding bit width (signed and unsigned)
float32 and float64 are single- and double-precision floating-point numbers, respectively
complex64 and complex128 are single- and double-precision complex numbers, respectively

array types can be specified by indexing any numeric type, 
    e.g. float32[:] for a one-dimension single-precision array 
    or int8[:,:] for a two-dimension array of 8-bit integers.

nogil = True can not hold Pythonâ€™s global interpreter lock (GIL). Useful when 
    writing programs on multi-core system
