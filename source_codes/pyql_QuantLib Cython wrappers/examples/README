1) Download swap and deposit rate data from the Federal Reserve database:
www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload

2) Read the csv file and build a time series of deposit and swap rates

Calibration of Heston model on SPX option data
==============================================

1) process_SPX_options.py computes:
    - market implied forward, interest rate and dividend yield
    - implied market volatility (bid/ask)
    - quick delta
    - filters quotes to retain only the quotes with a QD between .2 and .8
    
2) calibrate_heston estimate the parameters by non-linear least-square 
    error computed on difference between market vol and model vol
    
3) calibration_plot displays fitted and market vols at selected expiries.
