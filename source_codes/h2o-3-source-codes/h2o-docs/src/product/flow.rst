---------------------------------

About
------

H2O Flow is an open-source user interface for H2O. It is a web-based
interactive environment that allows you to combine code execution, text,
mathematics, plots, and rich media in a single document.

With H2O Flow, you can capture, rerun, annotate, present, and share your
workflow. H2O Flow allows you to use H2O interactively to import files,
build models, and iteratively improve them. Based on your models, you
can make predictions and add rich text to create vignettes of your work
- all within Flow's browser-based environment.

Flow's hybrid user interface seamlessly blends command-line computing
with a modern graphical user interface. However, rather than displaying
output as plain text, Flow provides a point-and-click user interface for
every H2O operation. It allows you to access any H2O object in the form
of well-organized tabular data.

H2O Flow sends commands to H2O as a sequence of executable cells. The
cells can be modified, rearranged, or saved to a library. Each cell
contains an input field that allows you to enter commands, define
functions, call other functions, and access other cells or objects on
the page. When you execute the cell, the output is a graphical object,
which can be inspected to view additional details.

While H2O Flow supports REST API, R scripts, and CoffeeScript, no
programming experience is required to run H2O Flow. You can click your
way through any H2O operation without ever writing a single line of
code. You can even disable the input cells to run H2O Flow using only
the GUI. H2O Flow is designed to guide you every step of the way, by
providing input prompts, interactive help, and example flows.


Download Flow
-------------

1. First `Download H2O <http://www.h2o.ai/download/>`_. This will download a zip file in your Downloads folder that contains everything you need to get started. Alternatively, you can run the following from your command line, replacing "{version}" with the appropriate version (for example, 3.8.2.5)

  ::

    curl -o h2o.zip http://download.h2o.ai/versions/h2o-{version}.zip
        

2. Next in your terminal, enter the following command lines one at a time:

  *(The first line changes into your Downloads folder, the second line unzips your zipfile, the third line changes into your h2o-3.8.2.3 folder, and the fourth line runs your jar file.)*::

    cd ~/Downloads
    unzip h2o-3.8.2.3.zip
    cd h2o-3.8.2.3
    java -jar h2o.jar

3. Finally, to start Flow point your browser to http://localhost:54321.


Launch Flow
-------------

The next time you want to launch Flow, change into the directory that contains your H2O package and run the JAR file from the command line.

**Note**: If your H2O package is not in the Downloads folder, replace the following path  ~/Downloads/h2o-{version} with the correct path to your h2o-{version} package)::

  cd ~/Downloads/h2o-{version} 
  java -jar h2o.jar


How to Use the Interface
------------------------

.. todo:: add link to the downloads page or add in infor here (is linking out bad?)

To access this documentation, select the **Flow Web UI...** link below
the **General** heading in the Help sidebar.

Viewing Example Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can explore the pre-configured flows available in H2O Flow for a demonstration of how to create a flow. To view the example flows:

-  Click the **view example Flows** link below the **Quickstart Videos**
   button in the **Help** sidebar 
   
   |Flow - View Example Flows link|

 --OR--
 
-  Click the **Browse installed packs...** link in the **Packs**
   subsection of the **Help** sidebar. Click the **examples** folder and
   select the example flow from the list.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ExampleFlows.png
   :alt: Flow Packs

If you have a flow currently open, a confirmation window appears asking
if the current notebook should be replaced. To load the example flow,
click the **Load Notebook** button.

Viewing REST API Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the REST API documentation, click the **Help** tab in the
sidebar and then select the type of REST API documentation (**Routes**
or **Schemas**).

.. figure:: images/Flow_REST_docs.png
   :alt: REST API documentation

Before getting started with H2O Flow, make sure you understand the different cell modes. (Refer to `Understanding Cell Modes`_.) Certain actions can only be performed when the cell is in a specific mode.

Using Flows
-----------

You can use and modify flows in a variety of ways:

-  Clips allow you to save single cells
-  Outlines display summaries of your workflow
-  Flows can be saved, duplicated, loaded, or downloaded

--------------

.. _Using Clips:

Using Clips
^^^^^^^^^^^

Clips enable you to save cells containing your workflow for later reuse.
To save a cell as a clip, click the paperclip icon to the right of the
cell (highlighted in the red box in the following screenshot).
|Paperclip icon|

To use a clip in a workflow, click the "Clips" tab in the sidebar on the
right.

.. figure:: images/Flow_clips.png
   :alt: Clips tab

All saved clips, including the default system clips (such as ``assist``,
``importFiles``, and ``predict``), are listed. Clips you have created
are listed under the "My Clips" heading. To select a clip to insert,
click the circular button to the left of the clip name. To delete a
clip, click the trashcan icon to right of the clip name.

**NOTE**: The default clips listed under "System" cannot be deleted.

Deleted clips are stored in the trash. To permanently delete all clips
in the trash, click the **Empty Trash** button.

**NOTE**: Saved data, including flows and clips, are persistent as long
as the same IP address is used for the cluster. If a new IP is used,
previously saved flows and clips are not available.

Viewing Outlines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Outline** tab in the sidebar displays a brief summary of the cells
currently used in your flow; essentially, a command history.

-  To jump to a specific cell, click the cell description.
-  To delete a cell, select it and press the X key on your keyboard.

 .. figure:: images/Flow_outline.png
    :alt: View Outline


.. _Saving Flows:

Saving Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can save your flow for later reuse. To save your flow as a notebook,
click the "Save" button (the first button in the row of buttons below
the flow name), or click the drop-down "Flow" menu and select "Save
Flow." To enter a custom name for the flow, click the default flow name
("Untitled Flow") and type the desired flow name. A pencil icon
indicates where to enter the desired name.

.. figure:: images/Flow_rename.png
   :alt: Renaming Flows


To confirm the name, click the checkmark to the right of the name field.

.. figure:: images/Flow_rename2.png
   :alt: Confirm Name

To reuse a saved flow, click the "Flows" tab in the sidebar, then click
the flow name. To delete a saved flow, click the trashcan icon to the
right of the flow name.

.. figure:: images/Flow_flows.png
   :alt: Flows


Finding Saved Flows on Your Disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, flows are saved to the ``h2oflows`` directory underneath
your home directory. The directory where flows are saved is printed to
stdout:

::

    03-20 14:54:20.945 172.16.2.39:54323     95667  main      INFO: Flow dir: '/Users/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/h2oflows'

To back up saved flows, copy this directory to your preferred backup
location.

To specify a different location for saved flows, use the command-line
argument ``-flow_dir`` when launching H2O:

::

  java -jar h2o.jar -flow_dir /[ENTER_PATH_TO_FLOW_DIRECTORY_HERE]

If the directory that you enter in place of ``[ENTER_PATH_TO_FLOW_DIRECTORY_HERE]`` does not exist, it will be created
the first time you save a flow.

Saving Flows on a Hadoop Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running H2O Flow on a Hadoop cluster, H2O will try to find
the HDFS home directory to use as the default directory for flows. If
the HDFS home directory is not found, flows cannot be saved unless a
directory is specified while launching using ``-flow_dir``:

::

  hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -nodes 1 -mapperXmx 6g -output hdfsOutputDirName -flow_dir hdfs://[HOST]:[PORT_NUMBER]/[PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_HERE]

The location specified in ``-flow_dir`` may be either an hdfs or regular
filesystem directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be
created the first time you save a flow.

Copying Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a copy of the current flow, select the **Flow** menu, then
click **Make a Copy**. The name of the current flow changes to
``Copy of <FlowName>`` (where ``<FlowName>`` is the name of the flow).
You can save the duplicated flow using this name by clicking **Flow** >
**Save Flow**, or rename it before saving. (Refer to `Saving Flows`_.)

Downloading Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After saving a flow as a notebook, click the **Flow** menu, then select
**Download this Flow**. A new window opens and the saved flow is
downloaded to the default downloads folder on your computer. The file is
exported as ``<filename>.flow``, where ``<filename>`` is the name
specified when the flow was saved.

**Caution**: You must have an active internet connection to download
flows.

Loading Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To load a saved flow, click the **Flows** tab in the sidebar at the
right. In the pop-up confirmation window that appears, select **Load
Notebook**, or click **Cancel** to return to the current flow.

.. figure:: images/Flow_confirmreplace.png
   :alt: Confirm Replace Flow

After clicking **Load Notebook**, the saved flow is loaded.

To load an exported flow, click the **Flow** menu and select **Open
Flow...**. In the pop-up window that appears, click the **Choose File**
button and select the exported flow, then click the **Open** button.

.. figure:: images/Flow_Open.png
   :alt: Open Flow

**Notes**:

    -  Only exported flows using the default .flow filetype are
       supported. Other filetypes will not open.
    -  If the current notebook has the same name as the selected file, a
       pop-up confirmation appears to confirm that the current notebook
       should be overwritten.

.. _Understanding Cell Modes:

Understanding Cell Modes
------------------------

There are two modes for cells: Edit and Command.

.. _Using Edit Mode:

Using Edit Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In edit mode, the cell is yellow with a blinking bar
to indicate where text can be entered and there is an orange flag to the
left of the cell.

.. figure:: images/Flow_EditMode.png
   :alt: Edit Mode

.. _Using Command Mode: 

Using Command Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In command mode, the flag is yellow. The flag also indicates the cell's format:

-  **MD**: Markdown

 **Note**: Markdown formatting is not applied until you run the cell by:

 -  clicking the **Run** button |Flow - Run Button| or
 -  pressing **Ctrl+Enter**

 .. figure:: images/Flow_markdown.png
    :alt: Flow - Markdown

-  **CS**: Code (default)

  .. figure:: images/Flow_parse_code_ex.png
     :alt: Flow - Code

-  **RAW**: Raw format (for code comments)

  .. figure:: images/Flow_raw.png
     :alt: Flow - Raw

-  **H[1-6]**: Heading level (where 1 is a first-level heading)

  .. figure:: images/Flow_headinglevels.png
     :alt: Flow - Heading Levels

 **NOTE**: If there is an error in the cell, the flag is red.

  .. figure:: images/Flow_redflag.png
     :alt: Cell error

If the cell is executing commands, the flag is teal. The flag returns to
yellow when the task is complete.

.. figure:: images/Flow_cellmode_runningflag.png
   :alt: Cell executing

--------------

Changing Cell Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the cell's format (for example, from code to Markdown), make
sure you are in command (not edit) mode and that the cell you want to
change is selected. The easiest way to do this is to click on the flag
to the left of the cell. Enter the keyboard shortcut for the format you
want to use. The flag's text changes to display the current format.

+-------------+---------------------+
| Cell Mode   | Keyboard Shortcut   |
+=============+=====================+
| Code        | ``y``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Markdown    | ``m``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Raw text    | ``r``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Heading 1   | ``1``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Heading 2   | ``2``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Heading 3   | ``3``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Heading 4   | ``4``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Heading 5   | ``5``               |
+-------------+---------------------+
| Heading 6   | ``6``               |
+-------------+---------------------+

Running Cells
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The series of buttons at the top of the page below the menus run cells
in a flow.

.. figure:: images/Flow_RunButtons.png
   :alt: Flow - Run Buttons

-  To run all cells in the flow, click the **Flow** menu, then click
   **Run All Cells**.
-  To run the current cell and all subsequent cells, click the **Flow**
   menu, then click **Run All Cells Below**.
-  To run an individual cell in a flow, confirm the cell is in Edit
   Mode (refer to `Using Edit Mode`_), then:

   -  press **Ctrl+Enter**

     or

   -  click the **Run** button |Flow - Run Button|

Running Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you run the flow, a progress bar indicates the current status of
the flow. You can cancel the currently running flow by clicking the
**Stop** button in the progress bar.

.. figure:: images/Flow_progressbar.png
   :alt: Flow Progress Bar


When the flow is complete, a message displays in the upper right.

|Flow - Completed Successfully| |Flow - Did Not Complete|

    **Note**: If there is an error in the flow, H2O Flow stops at the
    cell that contains the error.

Using Keyboard Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some important keyboard shortcuts to remember:

-  Click a cell and press **Enter** to enter edit mode, which allows you
   to change the contents of a cell.
-  To exit edit mode, press **Esc**.
-  To execute the contents of a cell, press the **Ctrl** and **Enter**
   buttons at the same time.

The following commands must be entered in Command Mode. (Refer to `Using Command Mode`_.)

-  To add a new cell *above* the current cell, press **a**.
-  To add a new cell *below* the current cell, press **b**.
-  To delete the current cell, press the **d** key *twice*. (**dd**).

You can view these shortcuts by clicking **Help** > **Keyboard
Shortcuts** or by clicking the **Help** tab in the sidebar.

Using Variables in Cells
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables can be used to store information such as download locations.
To use a variable in Flow:

1. Define the variable in a code cell (for example, ``locA = "https://h2o-public-test-data.s3.amazonaws.com/bigdata/laptop/kdd2009/small-churn/kdd_train.csv"``).

   .. figure:: images/Flow_VariableDefinition.png

2. Run the cell. H2O validates the variable.

  .. figure:: images/Flow_VariableValidation.png

3. Use the variable in another code cell (for example, ``importFiles [locA]``). 

  .. figure:: images/Flow_VariableExample.png


To further simplify your workflow, you can save the cells containing the variables and definitions as clips. (Refer to `Using Clips`_.)

Using Flow Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are also a series of buttons at the top of the page below the flow
name that allow you to save the current flow, add a new cell, move cells
up or down, run the current cell, and cut, copy, or paste the current
cell. If you hover over the button, a description of the button's
function displays.

.. figure:: images/Flow_buttons.png
   :alt: Flow buttons

| You can also use the menus at the top of the screen to edit the order
  of the cells, toggle specific format types (such as input or output),
  create models, or score models. You can also access troubleshooting
  information or obtain help with Flow.
| |Flow menus|

    **Note**: To disable the code input and use H2O Flow strictly as a
    GUI, click the **Cell** menu, then **Toggle Cell Input**.

Now that you are familiar with the cell modes, let's import some data.

--------------

Importing Data
--------------

If you don't have any data of your own to work with, you can find some
example datasets at http://data.h2o.ai.

Importing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are multiple ways to import data in H2O flow:

-  Click the **Assist Me!** button in the row of buttons below the
   menus, then click the **importFiles** link. Enter the file path in
   the auto-completing **Search** entry field and press **Enter**.
   Select the file from the search results and confirm it by clicking
   the **Add All** link. |Flow - Import Files Auto-Suggest|

-  In a blank cell, select the CS format, then enter
   ``importFiles ["path/filename.format"]`` (where
   ``path/filename.format`` represents the complete file path to the
   file, including the full file name. The file path can be a local file
   path or a website address. **Note**: For S3 file locations, use the
   format ``importFiles [ "s3n:/path/to/bucket/file/file.tab.gz" ]``

  **Note**: For an example of how to import a single file or a directory in R, refer to the following `example <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-2/blob/master/R/tests/testdir_hdfs/runit_s3n_basic.R>`__.

After selecting the file to import, the file path displays in the
"Search Results" section. To import a single file, click the plus sign
next to the file. To import all files in the search results, click the
**Add all** link. The files selected for import display in the "Selected
Files" section. |Import Files|

 **Note**: If the file is compressed, it will only be read using a single thread. For best performance, we recommend uncompressing the file before importing, as this will allow use of the faster multithreaded distributed parallel reader during import. Please note that .zip files containing multiple files are not currently supported.

-  To import the selected file(s), click the **Import** button.

-  To remove all files from the "Selected Files" list, click the **Clear
   All** link.

-  To remove a specific file, click the **X** next to the file path.

After you click the **Import** button, the raw code for the current job
displays. A summary displays the results of the file import, including
the number of imported files and their Network File System (nfs)
locations.

.. figure:: images/Flow_import_results.png
   :alt: Import Files - Results


Uploading Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To upload a local file, click the **Data** menu and select **Upload
File...**. Click the **Choose File** button, select the file, click the
**Choose** button, then click the **Upload** button.

.. figure:: images/Flow_UploadDataset.png
   :alt: File Upload Pop-Up


When the file has uploaded successfully, a message displays in the upper
right and the **Setup Parse** cell displays.

.. figure:: images/Flow_FileUploadPass.png
   :alt: File Upload Successful

Ok, now that your data is available in H2O Flow, let's move on to the
next step: parsing. Click the **Parse these files** button to continue.

--------------

Parsing Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you have imported your data, parse the data.

.. figure:: images/Flow_parse_setup.png
   :alt: Flow - Parse options


The read-only **Sources** field shows the file path for the imported data selected for parsing. The **ID** contains the auto-generated name for the parsed data (by default, the file name of the imported file uses ``.hex`` as the file extension). Use the default name or enter a custom name in this field.

1. Select the parser type (if necessary) from the drop-down **Parser** list. For most data parsing, H2O automatically recognizes the data type, so the default settings typically do not need to be changed. The following options are available:

 -  Auto
 -  ARFF
 -  XLS
 -  XLSX
 -  CSV
 -  SVMLight

 **Note**: For SVMLight data, the column indices must be >= 1 and the columns must be in ascending order.

2. If a separator or delimiter is used, select it from the **Separator** list.

3. Select a column header option, if applicable:

 -  **Auto**: Automatically detect header types.
 -  **First row contains column names**: Specify heading as column names.
 -  **First row contains data**: Specify heading as data. This option is selected by default.

4. Select any necessary additional options:

 -  **Enable single quotes as a field quotation character**: Treat single quote marks (also known as apostrophes) in the data as a character, rather than an enum. This option is not selected by default.
 -  **Delete on done**: Check this checkbox to delete the imported data after parsing. This option is selected by default.

A preview of the data displays in the "Edit Column Names and Types" section. To change or add a column name, edit or enter the text in the column's entry field. In the screenshot below, the entry field for column 16 is highlighted in red.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ColNameEntry.png
   :alt: Flow - Column Name Entry Field

To change the column type, select the drop-down list to the right of the column name entry field and select the data type. The options are:

-  Unknown
-  Numeric
-  Enum
-  Time
-  UUID
-  String
-  Invalid

You can search for a column by entering it in the *Search by column
name...* entry field above the first column name entry field. As you
type, H2O displays the columns that match the specified search terms.

**Note**: Only custom column names are searchable. Default column names
cannot be searched.

To navigate the data preview, click the **<- Previous page** or **->
Next page** buttons.

.. figure:: images/Flow_PageButtons.png
   :alt: Flow - Pagination buttons

After making your selections, click the **Parse** button. The code for the current job
displays.

.. figure:: images/Flow_parse_code_ex.png
   :alt: Flow - Parse code


Since we've submitted a couple of jobs (data import & parse) to H2O now,
let's take a moment to learn more about jobs in H2O.

--------------

Viewing Jobs
--------------

Any command you enter in H2O (such as ``importFiles``) is submitted as a job, which is associated with a key. The key identifies the job within H2O and is used as a reference.

Viewing All Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view all jobs, click the **Admin** menu, then click **Jobs**, or
enter ``getJobs`` in a cell in CS mode.

.. figure:: images/Flow_getJobs.png
   :alt: View Jobs

The following information displays:

-  Type (for example, ``Frame`` or ``Model``)
-  Link to the object
-  Description of the job type (for example, ``Parse`` or ``GBM``)
-  Start time
-  End time
-  Run time

To refresh this information, click the **Refresh** button. To view the
details of the job, click the **View** button.

Viewing Specific Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view a specific job, click the link in the "Destination" column.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ViewJob_Model.png
   :alt: View Job - Model

The following information displays:

-  Type (for example, ``Frame``)
-  Link to object (key)
-  Description (for example, ``Parse``)
-  Status
-  Run time
-  Progress

**Note**: For a better understanding of how jobs work, make sure to
review the `Viewing Frames`_ section as well.

Ok, now that you understand how to find jobs in H2O, let's submit a new
one by building a model.

--------------

Models
------


Building Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several ways to build a model, you can:

- Click the **Assist Me!** button in the row of buttons below the menus and select **buildModel**

- Click the **Assist Me!** button, select **getFrames**, then click the **Build Model...** button below the parsed .hex data set

- Click the **View** button after parsing data, then click the **Build Model** button

- Click the drop-down **Model** menu and select the model type from the list

The **Build Model...** button can be accessed from any page containing
the .hex key for the parsed data (for example, ``getJobs`` >
``getFrame``). The following image depicts the K-Means model type.
Available options vary depending on model type.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ModelBuilder.png
   :alt: Model Builder


In the **Build a Model** cell, select an algorithm from the drop-down menu. (Refer to the `Data Science Algorithms <data-science.html>`_ section for information about the available algorithms.)

 - **K-means**: Create a K-Means model.
 - **Generalized Linear Model**: Create a Generalized Linear model.
 - **Distributed RF**: Create a distributed Random Forest model.
 - **Naïve Bayes**: Create a Naïve Bayes model.
 - **Principal Component Analysis**: Create a Principal Components Analysis model for modeling without regularization or performing dimensionality reduction.
 - **Gradient Boosting Machine**: Create a Gradient Boosted model
 - **Deep Learning**: Create a Deep Learning model.

The available options vary depending on the selected model. If an option
is only available for a specific model type, the model type is listed.
If no model type is specified, the option is applicable to all model
types.

-  **model\_id**: (Optional) Enter a custom name for the model to use as
   a reference. By default, H2O automatically generates an ID containing
   the model type (for example,
   ``gbm-6f6bdc8b-ccbc-474a-b590-4579eea44596``).

-  **training\_frame**: (Required) Select the dataset used to build the
   model.

-  **validation\_frame**: (Optional) Select the dataset used to evaluate
   the accuracy of the model.

-  **nfolds**: (GLM, GBM, DL, DRF) Specify the number of folds for cross-validation.

-  **response\_column**: (Required for GLM, GBM, DL, DRF, Naïve Bayes) Select the
   column to use as the independent variable.

-  **ignored\_columns**: (Optional) Click the checkbox next to a column
   name to add it to the list of columns excluded from the model. To add
   all columns, click the **All** button. To remove a column from the
   list of ignored columns, click the X next to the column name. To
   remove all columns from the list of ignored columns, click the
   **None** button. To search for a specific column, type the column
   name in the **Search** field above the column list. To only show
   columns with a specific percentage of missing values, specify the
   percentage in the **Only show columns with more than 0% missing
   values** field. To change the selections for the hidden columns, use
   the **Select Visible** or **Deselect Visible** buttons.

-  **ignore\_const\_cols**: (Optional) Check this checkbox to ignore
   constant training columns, since no information can be gained from
   them. This option is selected by default.

-  **transform**: (PCA) Select the transformation method for
   the training data: None, Standardize, Normalize, Demean, or Descale.

-  **pca\_method**: (PCA) Select the algorithm to use for
   computing the principal components:

   -  *GramSVD*: Uses a distributed computation of the Gram matrix,
      followed by a local SVD using the JAMA package
   -  *Power*: Computes the SVD using the power iteration method
   -  *Randomized*: Uses randomized subspace iteration method
   -  *GLRM*: Fits a generalized low-rank model with L2 loss function
      and no regularization and solves for the SVD using local matrix
      algebra

-  **family**: (GLM) Select the model type (Gaussian,
   Binomial, Multinomial, Poisson, Gamma, or Tweedie).

-  **solver**: (GLM) Select the solver to use (AUTO, IRLSM,
   L\_BFGS, COORDINATE\_DESCENT\_NAIVE, or COORDINATE\_DESCENT). IRLSM
   is fast on on problems with a small number of predictors and for
   lambda-search with L1 penalty, while
   `L\_BFGS <http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lbfgs/vignettes/Vignette.pdf>`__
   scales better for datasets with many columns. COORDINATE\_DESCENT is
   IRLSM with the covariance updates version of cyclical coordinate
   descent in the innermost loop. COORDINATE\_DESCENT\_NAIVE is IRLSM
   with the naive updates version of cyclical coordinate descent in the
   innermost loop. COORDINATE\_DESCENT\_NAIVE and COORDINATE\_DESCENT
   are currently experimental.

-  **link**: (GLM) Select a link function (Identity,
   Family\_Default, Logit, Log, Inverse, or Tweedie).

-  **alpha**: (GLM) Specify the regularization distribution
   between L2 and L2.

-  **lambda**: (GLM) Specify the regularization strength.

-  **lambda\_search**: (GLM) Check this checkbox to enable
   lambda search, starting with lambda max. The given lambda is then
   interpreted as lambda min.

-  **non-negative**: (GLM) To force coefficients to be
   non-negative, check this checkbox.

-  **standardize**: (K-Means, GLM) To
   standardize the numeric columns to have mean of zero and unit
   variance, check this checkbox. Standardization is highly recommended;
   if you do not use standardization, the results can include components
   that are dominated by variables that appear to have larger variances
   relative to other attributes as a matter of scale, rather than true
   contribution. This option is selected by default.

-  **beta\_constraints**: (GLM) To use beta constraints,
   select a dataset from the drop-down menu. The selected frame is used
   to constraint the coefficient vector to provide upper and lower

   lead to more overfitting. The levels are ordered alphabetically; if
   there are more levels than bins, adjacent levels share bins. This
   value has a more significant impact on model fitness than **nbins**.
   Larger values may increase runtime, especially for deep trees and
   large clusters, so tuning may be required to find the optimal value
   for your configuration.

-  **learn\_rate**: (GBM) Specify the learning rate. The range is 0.0 to 1.0.

   sampling rate (x-axis). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. Higher values may
   improve training accuracy. Test accuracy improves when either columns
   or rows are sampled. For details, refer to "Stochastic Gradient
   Boosting" (`Friedman,
   1999 <https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf>`__).

-  **col\_sample\_rate**: (GBM, DRF) Specify the
   column sampling rate (y-axis). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. Higher values
   may improve training accuracy. Test accuracy improves when either
   columns or rows are sampled. For details, refer to "Stochastic

   1999 <https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf>`__).

-  **mtries**: (DRF) Specify the columns to randomly select
   at each level. If the default value of ``-1`` is used, the number of

   classification and p/3 for regression (where p is the number of
   predictors).

-  **binomial\_double\_trees**: (DRF) (Binary classification
   only) Build twice as many trees (one per class). Enabling this option
   can lead to higher accuracy, while disabling can result in faster
   model building. This option is disabled by default.

-  **score\_each\_iteration**: (K-Means, DRF, Naïve Bayes, PCA, GBM, GLM) To score during each iteration of the model training, check this checkbox.

-  **k**\ \*: (K-Means, PCA) For K-Means, specify the number of clusters. For PCA, specify the rank of matrix approximation.

   compute metrics on training data, check this checkbox. The Naïve
   Bayes classifier assumes independence between predictor variables
   conditional on the response, and a Gaussian distribution of numeric
   predictors with mean and standard deviation computed from the
   training dataset. When building a Naïve Bayes classifier, every row
   in the training dataset that contains at least one NA will be skipped
   completely. If the test dataset has missing values, then those
   predictors are omitted in the probability calculation during
   prediction.

**Advanced Options**

-  **fold\_assignment**: (GLM, GBM, DL, DRF, K-Means) (Applicable only if a value
   for **nfolds** is specified and **fold\_column** is not selected)
   Select the cross-validation fold assignment scheme. The available

   `Modulo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation>`__.

-  **fold\_column**: (GLM, GBM, DL, DRF, K-Means) Select the column that
   contains the cross-validation fold index assignment per observation.

-  **offset\_column**: (GLM, DRF, GBM) Select a column to use as the offset. *Note*: Offsets are per-row "bias values" that are used during model training. For Gaussian distributions, they can be seen as simple corrections to the response (y) column. Instead of learning to predict the response (y-row), the model learns to predict the (row) offset of the response column. For other distributions, the offset corrections are applied in the linearized space before applying the inverse link function to get the actual response values. For more information, refer to the following `link <http://www.idg.pl/mirrors/CRAN/web/packages/gbm/vignettes/gbm.pdf>`__.

-  **weights\_column**: (GLM, DL, DRF, GBM) Select a column to use for the observation weights. The specified ``weights_column`` must be included in the specified ``training_frame``. *Python only*: To use a weights column when passing an H2OFrame to ``x`` instead of a list of column names, the specified ``training_frame`` must contain the specified ``weights_column``. *Note*: Weights are per-row observation weights and do not increase the size of the data frame. This is typically the number of times a row is repeated, but non-integer values are supported as well. During training, rows with higher weights matter more, due to the larger loss function pre-factor.

-  **loss**: (DL) Select the loss function. For DL, the
   options are Automatic, Quadratic, CrossEntropy, Huber, or Absolute
   and the default value is Automatic. Absolute, Quadratic, and Huber
   are applicable for regression or classification, while CrossEntropy

-  **balance\_classes**: (GBM, DL) Oversample the
   minority classes to balance the class distribution. This option is
   not selected by default and can increase the data frame size. This
   option is only applicable for classification. Majority classes can be
   undersampled to satisfy the **Max\_after\_balance\_size** parameter.

    **Note**: ``balance_classes`` balances over just the target, not over all classes in the training frame.

-  **max\_confusion\_matrix\_size**: (DRF, DL, Naïve Bayes, GBM, GLM) Specify the maximum size (in number of classes) for confusion matrices to be  printed in the Logs.

-  **max\_hit\_ratio\_k**: (DRF, DL, Naïve Bayes, GBM, GLM) Specify the maximum number (top K) of predictions to use for hit ratio computation. Applicable to multinomial only. To disable, enter 0.

-  **build\_tree\_one\_node**: (DRF, GBM) To run on a single node, check this checkbox. This is suitable for small datasets as there is no network overhead but fewer CPUs are used. The
   default setting is disabled.

-  **rate**: (DL) Specify the learning rate. Higher rates result in less stable models and lower rates result in slower convergence. Not applicable if **adaptive\_rate** is enabled.

   Uniform Adaptive is used, the **initial\_weight\_scale** parameter is
   not applicable.

-  **initial\_weight\_scale**: (DL) Specify the initial weight
   scale of the distribution function for Uniform or Normal
   distributions. For Uniform, the values are drawn uniformly from
   initial weight scale. For Normal, the values are drawn from a Normal
   distribution with the standard deviation of the initial weight scale.
   If Uniform Adaptive is selected as the
   **initial\_weight\_distribution**, the **initial\_weight\_scale**
   parameter is not applicable.

Some model types, such as DRF, GBM, and Deep Learning, support
checkpointing. A checkpoint resumes model training so that you can
iterate your model. The dataset must be the same. The following model
parameters must be the same when restarting a model from a checkpoint:

+-------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Must be the same as in checkpoint model   |                                |                                     |

Interpreting Model Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Scoring history**: (GBM, DL) Represents the error
rate of the model as it is built. Typically, the error rate will be
higher at the beginning (the left side of the graph) then decrease as
the model building completes and accuracy improves. Can include mean
squared error (MSE) and deviance.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ScoringHistory.png
   :alt: Scoring History example

**Variable importances**: (GBM, DL) Represents the
statistical significance of each variable in the data in terms of its
affect on the model. Variables are listed in order of most to least
importance. The percentage values represent the percentage of importance
across all variables, scaled to 100%. The method of computing each
variable's importance depends on the algorithm. To view the scaled
importance value of a variable, use your mouse to hover over the bar
representing the variable.

.. figure:: images/Flow_VariableImportances.png
   :alt: Variable Importances example


**Confusion Matrix**: (DL) Table depicting performance of
algorithm in terms of false positives, false negatives, true positives,
and true negatives. The actual results display in the columns and the
predictions display in the rows; correct predictions are highlighted in
yellow. In the example below, ``0`` was predicted correctly 902 times,
while ``8`` was predicted correctly 822 times and ``0`` was predicted as
``4`` once.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ConfusionMatrix.png
   :alt: Confusion Matrix example


**ROC Curve**: (DL, GLM, DRF) Graph representing the ratio of true positives to false positives. To view a
specific threshold, select a value from the drop-down **Threshold** list. To view any of the following details, select it from the drop-down **Criterion** list:

-  Max f1
-  Max f2
-  Max f0point5
-  Max accuracy
-  Max precision
-  Max absolute MCC (the threshold that maximizes the absolute Matthew's
   Correlation Coefficient)
-  Max min per class accuracy

The lower-left side of the graph represents less tolerance for false
positives while the upper-right represents more tolerance for false
positives. Ideally, a highly accurate ROC resembles the following
example.

.. figure:: images/Flow_ROC.png
   :alt: ROC Curve example

**Hit Ratio**: (GBM, DRF, NaiveBayes, DL, GLM) (Multinomial Classification only) Table representing the number of times that the prediction was correct out of the total number of predictions.

.. figure:: images/HitRatioTable.png
   :alt: Hit Ratio Table


**Standardized Coefficient Magnitudes** (GLM) Bar chart
representing the relationship of a specific feature to the response
variable. Coefficients can be positive (orange) or negative (blue). A
positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship between the
feature and the response, where an increase in the feature corresponds
with an increase in the response, while a negative coefficient
represents a negative relationship between the feature and the response
where an increase in the feature corresponds with a decrease in the
response (or vice versa).

Predictions
-----------

.. todo:: address how to use a Pojo with Flow

After creating your model, click the key link for the model, then click
the **Predict** button. Select the model to use in the prediction from
the drop-down **Model:** menu and the data frame to use in the
prediction from the drop-down **Frame:** menu, then click the
**Predict** button.

.. figure:: images/Flow_makePredict.png
   :alt: Making Predictions



Viewing Predictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click the **Assist Me!** button, then click the **getPredictions** link,
or enter ``getPredictions`` in the cell in CS mode and press
**Ctrl+Enter**. A list of the stored predictions displays. To view a
prediction, click the **View** button to the right of the model name.

.. figure:: images/Flow_getPredict.png
   :alt: Viewing Predictions

You can also view predictions by clicking the drop-down **Score** menu
and selecting **List All Predictions**.


Intepreting the Gains/Lift Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Gains/Lift chart evaluates the prediction ability of a binary classification model. The chart is computed using the prediction probability and the true response (class) labels. The accuracy of the classification model for a random sample is evaluated according to the results when the model is and is not used. 

This information is particularly useful for direct marketing applications, for example. The gains/lift chart shows the effectiveness of the current model(s) compared to a baseline, allowing users to quickly identify the most useful model.

By default, H2O reports the Gains/Lift for all binary classification models if the following requirements are met:

- The training frame dataset must contain actual binary class labels.
- The prediction column used as the response must contain probabilities.
- For GLM, the visualization displays only when using ``nfolds`` (for example, ``nfolds=2``).
- The model type cannot be K-means or PCA.

How the Gains/Lift Chart is Built
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compute Gains/Lift, H2O applies the model to the original dataset to find the response probability. The data is divided into groups by quantile thresholds of the response probability. Note that the default number of groups is 20; if there are fewer than 20 unique probability values, then the number of groups is reduced to the number of unique quantile thresholds. For binning, H2O computes exact ventiles. (Weighted cases are in development.) ``h2o.quantile(x, probs=seq(0,1,0.05))`` is used for cut points, similar to R's ``quantile()`` method. 

For each group, the lift is calculated as the proportion of observations that are events (targets) in the group to the overall proportion of events (targets). 

.. figure:: images/GainsLift.png
   :alt: Gains/Lift Chart

**Note**: During the Gains/Lift calculations, all rows containing missing values ("NAs") in either the label (response) or the prediction probability are ignored. 

In addition to the chart, a Gains/Lift table is also available. This table reports the following for each group:

- Threshold probability value
- Cumulative data fractions
- Response rates (proportion of observations that are events in a group)
- Cumulative response rate
- Event capture rate
- Cumulative capture rate
- Gain (difference in percentages between the overall proportion of events and the observed proportion of observations that are events in the group)
- Cumulative gain

.. figure:: images/GainsLiftTable.png
   :alt: Gains/Lift Table

The *response_rate* column lists the likelihood of response, the *lift* column lists the lift rate, and the *cumulative_lift* column provides the percentage of increase in response based on the lift.

--------------

Frames
--------------

An H2O frame represents a 2D array of data. The data may be local or it may be distributed in an H2O cluster. 

Creating Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a frame with a large amount of random data (for example, to use for testing), click the drop-down **Admin** menu, then select **Create Synthetic Frame**. Customize the frame as needed, then click the **Create** button to create the frame. 

.. figure:: images/Flow_CreateFrame.png
   :alt: Create Frame

Viewing Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view a specific frame, click the "Key" link for the specified frame,
or enter ``getFrameSummary "FrameName"`` in a cell in CS mode (where
``FrameName`` is the name of a frame, such as ``allyears2k.hex``).

.. figure:: images/Flow_getFrame.png
   :alt: Viewing specified frame


From the ``getFrameSummary`` cell, you can:

-  View a truncated list of the rows in the data frame by clicking the
   **View Data** button
-  Split the dataset by clicking the **Split...** button
-  View the columns, data, and factors in more detail or plot a graph by
   clicking the **Inspect** button
-  Create a model by clicking the **Build Model** button
-  Make a prediction based on the data by clicking the **Predict**
   button
-  Download the data as a .csv file by clicking the **Download** button
-  View the characteristics or domain of a specific column by clicking
   the **Summary** link

When you view a frame, you can "drill-down" to the necessary level of
detail (such as a specific column or row) using the **Inspect** button
or by clicking the links. The following screenshot displays the results
of clicking the **Inspect** button for a frame.

.. figure:: images/Flow_inspectFrame.png
   :alt: Inspecting Frames


This screenshot displays the results of clicking the **columns** link.

.. figure:: images/Flow_inspectCol.png
   :alt: Inspecting Columns


To view all frames, click the **Assist Me!** button, then click the
**getFrames** link, or enter ``getFrames`` in the cell in CS mode and
press **Ctrl+Enter**. You can also view all current frames by clicking
the drop-down **Data** menu and selecting **List All Frames**.

A list of the current frames in H2O displays that includes the following
information for each frame:

-  Link to the frame (the "key")
-  Number of rows and columns
-  Size

For parsed data, the following information displays:

-  Link to the .hex file
-  The **Build Model**, **Predict**, and **Inspect** buttons

.. figure:: images/Flow_getFrames.png
   :alt: Parsed Frames


To make a prediction, check the checkboxes for the frames you want to
use to make the prediction, then click the **Predict on Selected
Frames** button.

--------------

Splitting Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Datasets can be split within Flow for use in model training and testing.

.. figure:: images/Flow_splitFrame.png
   :alt: splitFrame cell

1. To split a frame, click the **Assist Me** button, then click
   **splitFrame**.

  **Note**: You can also click the drop-down **Data** menu and select **Split Frame...**. 
  
2. From the drop-down **Frame:** list, select the frame to split. 

3. In the second **Ratio** entry field, specify the fractional value to determine the split. The first **Ratio** field is automatically calculated based on the values entered in the second **Ratio** field.

  **Note**: Only fractional values between 0 and 1 are supported (for example, enter ``.5`` to split the frame in half). The total sum of the ratio values must equal one. H2O automatically adjusts the ratio values to equal one; if unsupported values are entered, an error displays.

4. In the **Key** entry field, specify a name for the new frame. 

5. (Optional) To add another split, click the **Add a split** link. To remove a split, click the ``X`` to the right of the **Key** entry field. 

6. Click the **Create** button.


Plotting Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a plot from a frame, click the **Inspect** button, then click
the **Plot** button for columns or factors. Note that from this section, you can also inspect the **Chunk compression summary** and the **Frame distribution summary**.  

.. figure:: images/Flow_plottingFrames.png
	:alt: Frames > Data

1. Select the type of plot from the **Type** menu

	- plot: Creates a graph with a series of plot points.
	- path: Creates a line graph connecting plot points.
	- rect: Creates a bar graph. Note that with rect graphs, you cannot specify values of the same type. You will receive an error if you attempt to specify, for example, two String columns or two Number columns.  

2. Specify the information that you want to view on the X axis and on the Y axis. Select from the following options below. These options correspond to the parsed data file. 

	-  label: Plots the column headings
	-  type: Plots real vs. enum values
	-  Missing: Plots missing values
	-  Zeros: Plots ``0`` values
	-  +Inf: Plots positiive ``inf`` values
	-  -Inf: Plots negative ``inf`` values
	-  min: Plots the min value
	-  max: Plots the max value
	-  mean: Plots the mean value
	-  sigma: Plots the sigma value
	-  cardinality: Plots the cardinality. Used with enum values.
	-  Actions: Plots actions (for example, "convert to numeric".)

3. Select one of the above options from the drop-down **Color** menu to display the specified data in color. 

4. click the **Plot** button to plot the data.

.. figure:: images/Flow_plot.png
   :alt: Flow - Plotting Frames

**Note**: Because H2O stores enums internally as numeric then maps the
integers to an array of strings, any ``min``, ``max``, or ``mean``
values for categorical columns are not meaningful and should be ignored.
Displays for categorical data will be modified in a future version of
H2O.
